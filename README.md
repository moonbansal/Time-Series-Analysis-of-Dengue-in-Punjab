# Time Series Analysis of Dengue in Punjab

This project analyzes dengue data from districts of Punjab, incorporating Breteau Index (BI), House Index (HI), Container Index (CI), and meteorological factors such as rainfall and temperature. By identifying correlations and dependencies between dengue cases and these factors, it aims to predict trends for upcoming years.

## Introduction

Dengue is a significant public health issue, particularly in Punjab, where recent research has been limited. This project leverages time series analysis and correlation studies to understand the relationship between dengue cases and environmental or epidemiological factors. The goal is to enable authorities to take preventative measures based on predictions, mitigating the impact of dengue outbreaks.
